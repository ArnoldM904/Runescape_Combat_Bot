# Runescape_Combat_Bot
Runescape Combat Bot created by [Datosh](https://github.com/datosh) and myself using the [OSBot API](http://osbot.org/api/). The bot is a basic combat/fighting bot used for Old School Runescape ([2007 version](http://oldschool.runescape.com/)) with the function of fighting targets to gain experience & gold and its purpose is to serve as a personal project for my friend Datosh and I to further our knowledge of programming.

Currently the bot is on version 0.5 and is placed on hold for more personally interesting projects. For any questions please feel free to send an email!
