Notes for Runescape Combat Bot:


To do list:
  - Fix bugs
  - Make the GUI more asthetically appealing
  - Change default target to user input
  - Change default lootable items to user input
  - Change default bury bones to user input
  - Add option to bank at starter town (Lumbridge bank located on the 3rd floor of the castle)
  - Add anti-ban features (Ex: Check skills, look at friends list, etc..)
  
  
Potential feature ideas:
  - Add a "Gold Earned: " counter with the value of items looted.
  - Add a "Total items looted: " counter
  - Add a "Total targets slain: " counter
  - Add ability to eat food when health is low and then go to the bank to get more food upon running out.
  
  
Bug list:
  - Bot attempts to attack creatures currently already under attack.
